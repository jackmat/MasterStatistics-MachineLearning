However, functional programming is the basis for many concurrent systems (the MapReduce programming model many big data systems, e.g. Hadoop, rely on gets its name from the *map* and *reduce* functions mentioned below). Python is a multi-paradigmatic language, and functional programming is one of the paradigms one can use in the mix, to understand how and when to do this, it is necessary to do things in a non-*pythonic* way in order to cover the basics."

    "\n",
    "In this lab there are some general rules you should keep in mind to make sure you are on the correct path in your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules\n",
    "1. You are not allowed to use `while` or `for` statements.\n",
    "2. You are not allowed to use global variables (other than for functions defined in the global environment).\n",
    "3. Code stubs should be viewed as fixed, you are only allowed to add code, the only code you are allowed to change is `pass` statements, which you should remove.\n",
    "4. You should refrain from using the `list` datatype unless otherwise specified and instead use `tuple`. One of the strengths of functional programming is its focus on immutable data types (this is why functional programming and concurrency goes so well together).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advice\n",
    "1. Avoid local variables unless you are certain they are necessary, in most cases you won't need to use local variables. (altermatively, use local variables to your hearts content, but when your solution works, try to eliminate them, you should be able to eliminate most of them, over time, you might find that you don't need them.)"

    "While Python is not a \"pure\" functional language like Haskell, or even a \"fully\" functional language like the Lisp family, it does implement a number of traditionally functional features. What it does lack however, is _Tail Call Optimization_ (_TCO_) which makes recursive algorithms much cheaper to run. Without going into too much detail, with _TCO_ the space complexity (how much of the computers memory we use) of simpler recursive algoritmhs is constant, which means we can theoretically recurse forever. However, without _TCO_, recursion has linear space complexity, which means that there is a limit to how many recursive calls we can make before we run out of memory even for simple algorithms. This means that one of the main features of functional programming, recursion, is not as useful in Python as in more functional languages.\n",

    "## 2 Higher-order functions and anonymous functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A _higher-order function_ is a function which operates on other functions. What this means exactly is disputed, one definition is that a higher-order function must itself return a function, another definition is that a higher-order function must take another function as input. We will play fast and loose with the definition and call any function which does either or both of these a higher-order function. (Conversely, a function neither taking another function as input nor returning a function we will refer to as a _first-order function_) In R you have encountered these when, for instance, using the `apply` family of functions, which are all versions of what is called a `map` function in functional programming (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using higher-order functions, it is often useful to create simple anonymous functions at the place in the code where they are used, rather than defining a new named function in one place only to call it in a single other place. In R, all functions are created in this way with the `function` keyword, but they are usually assigned to global names with standard assignment (`<-`). Python provides similar functionality using the `lambda` keyword (name inspired by Alonzo Church's $\\lambda$-calculus which has inspired much of functional programming) with which we can create anonymous functions. Of course, we can also pass named functions to higher-order functions, which is usually the case when the function is predefined, general enough to be used in more than one place, or complex enough to warrant separate definition and documentation for the sake of clarity."

    "### Standard higher-order functions: map, filter, reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three standard cases which are widely applicable and many other higher-order functions are special cases or combinations of these. They are: `map`, apply a function on each element in a sequence, `filter`, keep (or conversely, remove) elements from a sequence according to some condition, and `reduce`, combine the elements in a sequence. The `map` function takes a sequence and a function (usually of 1 parameter) which is to be applied to each element of the sequence and might return anything, this function is assumed not to have side effects. The `filter` function takes a function (usually of 1 parameter) which returns a boolean value used to indicate which elements are to be kept. The `reduce` function takes a function (usually of 2 parameters) which is used to combine the elements in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `map` and `filter` are standard functions, available in the global environment. However, since Python 3, the `reduce` function has been moved to the built-in `functools` module and needs to be imported before we can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many more advanced functions, of any order, can be created by combining these three higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the `reduce` function is more difficult to grasp than `map` and `filter` but I found this blog-post by AndrÃ© Burgaud to be a nice introduction to `reduce`. Note that Burgaud talks about the more general _fold_ concept rather than `reduce`, which is a special case of fold often called _left fold_ (this is covered in more detail in the post). https://www.burgaud.com/foldl-foldr-python/"

    "When doing data analysis, one very important part is pre-processing. Often, data goes through a number of steps of preprocessing, sometimes called a pipeline. The function composition example above can be seen as a special case of such a pipeline for only two functions. By clever use of higher order functions, we can build a pipeline function which takes a list or tuple of data transforming functions and creates a function which applies these sequentially. Construct such a function called `make_pipeline`. In order to focus on the primary purpose of the `make_pipeline` function, we will perform a very simple set of transformations, increment each value by 1, take the absolute value, and then take the square root. Usage example and code for the `inc` function is supplied below."

However, whenever a function is created inside another function, it has access to the environment of the function in which it is created. To access such variables, they have to be declared, in the inner function, using the `nonlocal` keyword. If we return this inner function, we have created a _closure_.\n",

To add this functionality, we can pass another argument to Quicksort which is applied to each element to compute a value on which it can be sorted.
