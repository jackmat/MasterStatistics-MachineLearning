    "The point of Object-oriented Programming is to support encapsulation and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle without things getting out of hand. Often, software architects (those high-level programmers who are responsible for how large systems are designed on a technical level) talk about Object-oriented design or Object-oriented analysis. The point of this is to identify the necessary _objects_ in a system. An object in this sense is not exactly the same as a Python object but rather a somewhat higher level logical unit which can reasonably be thought of as an independent component within the system. These high level objects might then be further subdivided into smaller and smaller objects and at a some level the responsibility shifts from the system architect to the team or individual developer working on a specific component. Thus, Object-oriented thinking is necessary for anyone developing code which will be integrated with a larger system, for instance a data scientist implementing analytics tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that the assignments in this part of Lab 2 will be at a higher level than the assignments in the FP part, not focusing as much on low level implementation of functions but rather on program organization. Therefore, you will also not get the same kind of code stubs or skeletons but will be required to build your code from scratch."

    "Python implements the Object-oriented paradigm to a somewhat larger degree than the Functional paradigm. However, there are features considered necessary for _strict_ object-oriented programming missing from Python. Mainly, we are talking about data protection. Not in a software security sense, but in the sense of encapsulation. There is no simple way to strictly control access to member variables in Python. This does not affect this lab in any way but is worth remembering if one has worked in a language such as Java previously."

The constructor should take 3 arguments, a given name, a surname and a date (use the date class in the datetime module) representing the persons birth date. The class should have the following instance functions (`get_full_name`, `get_birthdate` and `get_age`). The function `get_age` should return an integer representing the persons age in years. When Finished, run the test code for 1.1.\n",

Decorators can be thought of as _syntactic sugar_ to apply a higher-order function to some function to add specific behavior. You can write your own decorators and this is often used to combine the strengths of functional and object-oriented programming ([more on decorators](https://www.thecodeship.com/patterns/guide-to-python-function-decorators/)). What specific behavior is added by the `@classmethod` decorator?\n",
