    "There are currently two versions of Python in common use, Python 2 and Python 3, which are not 100% compatible. Python 2 is slowly being phased out but has a large enough install base to still be relevant. This course uses the more modern Python 3 but while searching for help online it is not uncommon to find help for Python 2. Especially older posts on sources such as Stack Exchange might refer to Python 2 as simply \"Python\". This should not cause any serious problems but keep it in mind whenever googling. With regards to this lab, the largest differences are how `print` works and the best practice recommendations for string formatting."
